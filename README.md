# Systems of linear equations

The project for Numerical Methods at Gdansk University of Technology. The aim of the project was to implement iterative (Jacobi and Gauss-Seidel) 
and direct (LU factorization) methods of solving systems of linear equations. Moreover, the above-mentioned algorithms were compared in terms of 
the number of iterations (for iterative methods) and their duration for systems of equations with specific parameters. The convergence of the iterative
methods and the accuracy of all three methods on the basis of the norm from the residuum vector were also examined.
